    * Update CMakeFiles.txt to work on FreeBSD12
    * Allow for "disk unlimited" to not remove captures at all, along with disabling in-memory indexing for that use.
    * Allow directory hierarchy and filename of class captures to be created dynamically according to date and time.

0.1-5 | 2014-08-26 15:35:00 -0800

    * Implemented the creation of index and query directories by default if the user did not create the index and query directories. Also,
      if indexes are not enabled, index directory is not created. If querying is not occuring, query directory is not created.

    * Implemented a counter instead of the many calls to gettimeofday when determining when to write to disk, which costed a lot of CPU.

    * Changed the hash table sizes to always be prime number, to help avoid clustering in the collisions lists. (Naoki Eto)

    * Added gperftools CPU profiler, which can be enabled by using --enable-gperftools-cpu in the ./configure option and
      adding a name to profilepath in the configuration file (Naoki Eto)

    * Changed the method for reading the configuration classes so that it is first ordered by precedence and then the highest precedence match is found (Naoki Eto)

    * Implemented querying for IPv4 and IPv6 ip, conn2, conn3, and conn4 (Naoki Eto)

    * Implemented class directories that can be specified in the configuration file. Example:
      ...
      filesize 2000m;
      mem 100m;
      classdir "/home/neto/data_http";
      }
      (Naoki Eto)

    * Implemented IPv6 support for the classes. (Naoki Eto)

    * VLAN tags are taken into account w/o MPLS labels (Naoki Eto)
